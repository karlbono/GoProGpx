Application for extracting GPX data from GoPro MP4 files

The app uses the libraries provided by GoPro to extract a gpx track from one or more video files created by a GoPro camera. It allows for minimal editing of the GPX file, author, name and description of the track and link to a website.

It also provides the possiblility of reducing the number of trackpoints or deleting certain points.

The app has been tested on footage from a GoPro Hero 7 Black camera. Testsresults on files from other GoPro cameras are welcome.

Download GoproGpx.zip if you just want the binary.
